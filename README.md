It contains projects and exercises in **C# (WPF MVVM)** and **Java**, focusing on learning, applying, and improving **software design patterns** and **clean coding principles**.

## Purpose
- To practice advanced coding concepts in both C# and Java.
- To strengthen my understanding of design patterns (e.g., MVVM, OOP practices).
- To build a portfolio that showcases my growth as a developer.
- To keep my studies organized and version-controlled using Git.

## Structure
- **/wpf-mvvm** → C# WPF MVVM exercises and sample projects
